# Merchant UI Sample
Sample Merchant UI project that I made as a test task project.

Items data, like sprites and their gold value are configurable, as well as initial player gold value and sell/buy coefficient.
Items can be sold/bought by Drag&Drop feature.

WIP: There is also an example of path finding algorytm, but without visualization since test task didn't required it.
