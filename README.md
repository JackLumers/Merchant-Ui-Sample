# Merchant UI Sample
Sample Merchant UI project that I made as a test task project I got.

Items data, like sprites and their gold value are configurable, as well as initial player gold value and sell/buy coefficient.
Items can be sold/bought by Drag&Drop feature.

Work In Progress: Example of path finding algorithm (second part of a test task)
